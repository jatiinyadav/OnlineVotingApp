## Submitting Contributions üëç
### Step 0 : Find an issue

- Take a look at the Existing Issues or create your **own** Issues!
- Wait for the Issue to be assigned to you after which you can start working on it.
- **Note:** Every change in this project should/must have an associated issue.

### Step 1 : Fork the Project
- Fork this repository. This will create a local copy of this repository on your GitLab Profile.

### Step 2 : Branch

Create a new branch. Use its name to identify the issue your addressing.

```bash
# It will create a new branch with name Branch_Name and switch to that branch 
git checkout -b branch_name
```

### Step 3 : Work on the issue assigned

- Work on the issue(s) assigned to you.
- Add all the files/folders needed.
- After you've made changes or made your contribution to the project add changes to the branch you've just created by:

```bash  
# To add all new files to branch Branch_Name  
git add .  

# To add only a few files to Branch_Name
git add <some files>
```

### Step 4 : Commit

- To commit give a descriptive message for the convenience of reviewer by:

```bash
# This message get associated with all files you have changed  
git commit -m "message"  
```

- **NOTE**: A PR should have only one commit. Multiple commits should be squashed.

### Step 5 : Work Remotely

- Now you are ready to push your work to the remote repository.
- When your work is ready and complies with the project conventions, upload your changes to your fork:

```bash  
# To push your work to your remote repository
git push -u origin Branch_Name
```

### Step 6 : Pull Request

- Go to your repository in browser and click on compare and pull requests.
Then add a title and description to your pull request that explains your contribution.  

- Voila! Your Pull Request has been submitted and will be reviewed by the moderators and merged.ü•≥
